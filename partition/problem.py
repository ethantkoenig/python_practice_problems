# Sorts the given list in-place (i.e. modifying the existing list instead of
# returning a new list) using quicksort.
#
# Arguments:
# l (type: list of ints): the list to partition. You may assume it is non-empty
# (i.e. has a length of at least 1).

# Example: in the following code
#
# l = [4,3,7,1,5]
# partition(l)
#
# `l` is now partitioned with a pivot of 4, and might equal [3,1,4,7,5]
# (although the order of the "less-than-4" and "greater-than-4" sections may
# vary).
def partition(l):
  pass # TODO: remove this placeholder, and write the function!


l = [4,3,7,1,5]
partition(l)
# l should now be partitioned with a pivot of 4 (e.g. possibly [3,1,4,7,5])
print(l)
