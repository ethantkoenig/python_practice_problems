# First, we'll need to figure out what the minimum and maximum elements in `l`
# are.
#
# Then, we'll need to create a hashtable (i.e. dictionary) whose keys are the
# elements of `l`.
#
# Finally, we'll need to create a new list (which we will ultimately return).
# We'll consider each number between the minimum and maximum. If the number is
# not in our hashtable/dictionary, then we know that it does not appear in `l`,
# and we'll need to append it to our to-be-returned list.
