# Returns a list of the numbers between the minimum and maximum value of `l`
# which are not present in `l`.
#
# Arguments:
# l (type: list of ints): list of ints, not necessarily sorted. You may assume
# the list is not empty (i.e. has a length of at least 1).
#
# Example:
# missing_from_range([7,2,8,4]) should return [3,5,6], because the numbers
# between the list's minimum (i.e. 2) and maximum (i.e. 8) which are not in list
# are 3, 5, and 6.
def missing_from_range(l):
  pass # TODO: remove this placeholder, and write the function!


# This should print [3, 5, 6]
print(missing_from_range([7, 2, 8, 4]))

# This should print []
print(missing_from_range([4, 2, 5, 3]))
