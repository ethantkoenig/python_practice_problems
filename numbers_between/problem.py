# (inclusive) start and (exclusive) end.
#
# Arguments:
# inclusive_start (type: int): the inclusive start of the sequence
# exclusive_end (type: int): the exclusive upper-bound of the sequence
#
# Example:
# numbers_between(3, 7) should return [3, 4, 5, 6]; note that the
# inclusive_start argument (3) is included, and the exclusive_end argument (7)
# is excluded.
def numbers_between(inclusive_start, exclusive_end):
  pass # TODO: remove this placeholder, and write the function!


# This should print [3, 4, 5, 6]
print(numbers_between(3, 7))
