# Hint 0:
# Notice that each edge of the island's perimeter is either horizontal or
# vertical.
#
# Hint 1:
# Observe that whenever two neighboring squares in a row have different values
# (i.e. one is water, the other is land), then the vertical edge between those
# squares is part of the island's perimeter.
#
# Hint 2:
# Also observe that whenever the leftmost/rightmost (i.e. first/last) square in
# a row is land (i.e. 1), then the left/right edge of that square,
# respectively, is part of the island's perimeter.
#
# Hint 3:
# If we had a method for finding the number of vertical edges, we could
# probably use a similar technique to find the number of horizontal edges.
