# See https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/. Note that when it says
# "two-dimensional integer grid", it just means a list of list of ints.
#
# Arguments:
# l (type: list of list of ints): As described in the link above. To reiterate,
#   each element of `l` (which is itself a list of ints) has the same length as
#   the other elements of `l` (which are also lists of ints).
#
# Example: see the example in the link above.
def island_perimeter(l):
  pass # TODO: remove this placeholder, and write the function!


l = [[0,1,0,0],
     [1,1,1,0],
     [0,1,0,0],
     [1,1,0,0]]
# This should print 16
print(island_perimeter(l))
