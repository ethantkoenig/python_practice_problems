# Returns whether the list contains the specified value.
#
# Arguments:
# l (type: list of ints): list that may or may not be sorted.
# value (type: int): value to check whether the list contains
#
# Example:
# list_contains([8,4,1,3], 1) should return True.
# list_contains([8,4,1,3], 6) should return False.
#
# NOTE: you are NOT allowed to use while-loops or for-loops in your solution
# (which means you'll have to use recursion).
def list_contains(l, value):
  pass # TODO: remove this placeholder, and write the function!


# This should print True.
print(list_contains([8,4,1,3], 1))

# This should print False.
print(list_contains([8,4,1,3], 6))
