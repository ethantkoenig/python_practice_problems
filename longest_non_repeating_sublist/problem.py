# Given a (unsorted) list of ints, return the longest sublist of that list that
# does not contain any repeating/duplicate elements. Sublists must be contiguous
# (i.e. must correspond to an uninterrupted range of the original list).
#
# If there are multiple such sublists that are tied for being the longest, the
# function should return one of them (doesn't matter which one).
#
# Arguments:
# l (type: list of ints): a list that is not necessarily sorted.
#
# Example:
# longest_non_repeating_subarray([1,2,3,2,5,4,2]) should return [3,2,5,4].
def longest_non_repeating_subarray(l):
  pass # TODO: remove this placeholder, and write the function!


# This should print [3,2,5,4]
print(longest_non_repeating_subarray([1,2,3,2,5,4,2]))
